# Course Scheduler
This is a Course Scheduler that I created for my CMPSC221 class at Penn State (Object Oriented Programming with Web-Based Applications).  It contains a student and teacher UX, allowing teachers to alter student and class properties, and students to schedule classes.  It utilizes the Swing API along with Apache Derby.
